# Doges-Cool-Repo
Add some cool features to my cool repos. 

## Fork my repo
1. in the top rightish there is a "fork" button. Click it for me.
2. This will create your very own special awesome cool version of my cool repo. 
3. This is your branch of the repo. Any changes you make should be made on your version, not mine. 
  - that way we don't get confused when we merge changes. 

## Clone your fork of the repo

  - It should say your username in the URL
2. git clone it using IntelliJ
